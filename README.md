# Fitness App

Flutter application for experiencing the workouts of Hollywood stars. At the beginning, the app will showcase a text about how Hollywood actors spend a significant amount of time sculpting their bodies to stay toned and fit. The user can explore and follow exercises inspired by famous Hollywood actors. On the main screen, the user can choose from a variety of workouts such as push-ups inspired by Rocky Johnson, abs exercises with Leonardo DiCaprio, and many more. Each exercise comes with detailed instructions and video demonstrations. The user can also track their progress, set workout goals, and filter exercises by muscle group, difficulty level, or actor.
